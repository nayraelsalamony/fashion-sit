             <p>For oily or acne-prone skin, a salicylic gel or benzoyl peroxide wash works great,"
                  says Dr. Ava Shamban, a dermatologist in Santa Monica. "For dry mature skin, 
                  use either a moisturizing glycolic or milky cleanser. For skin with brown spots or melasma,
                  use a brightening wash, such as an alpha hydroxy acid cleanser."
